Ideally the lip should be at least 1 3/8&#34; for best stability, but I got it to hold decently well on the short lip of my desk top, which is just 3/4&#34;.<br /><br />Because the front hanger piece can be adjusted to hang parallel or perpendicular, (or any angle in between), to the clamping surface, I was able to get the firmest grip on the side of a bookcase.  My best idea, and where I use it now, is attached to the arm of my executive style office chair, near where it meets the chair back.  I don't knock it with my arm or elbow as I raise/lower/turn in my chair.  It is really a nifty place to stow the headphones--within easy reach, but not a cumbersome location either.<br /><br />It is well-constructed with  good layer of powder coating on the metal.

I listen to music mostly on my iPad and have a subscription to Tidal premium musi service right now. The clarity of the music is amazing.

              "  '[[VIDEOID:3bdd17778455ef097fcffb1d018022b6]] There is a good variance in Bluetooth speakers, from physical design, extras in the box and sound quality. Not all speakers are worth your time and money. This little Cube speaker by iGadgitz is a very interesting speaker; it may be little but it has big sound and it works very well. I did find one potential issue when it comes to the range of operation that I will describe below.<br /><br />This is one of the smallest speakers I have seen and used. In spite of its size, it is a solid and hefty little speaker, weighing more than you\\'d expect. In my mind this is a good sign: it means that there is more to this little speaker than a cheap little speaker and a sub-par receiver. To be honest I was a little skeptical that it would put out good sound when I first saw this speaker. It has pleasantly surprised me (more on that shortly).<br /><br />This speaker pairs and connects very easily. When it is in discoverable mode it identifies itself as \\\\\\\\\"Xquare 2\\\\\\\\\". I had no issue with it pairing to my phone and once connected it remained connected without issue.<br /><br />The range on this speaker is good and I have been able to carry it from the source to a distance between 20\\' - 30\\' before it began to stutter or cut out. I have seen speakers that have more range but the majority of them fall into this threshold. Now, that said I need to mention an issue that came up in testing that should be kept in mind. If the speaker is sitting such that the switch and controls are facing down (that is, the control side is on the flat surface where it is sitting) the range is cut very dramatically. With the speaker sitting that way the range dropped to about 6\\' before it started cutting out. It did not seem to matter if it was the speaker that was moving away from the source or the other way around.<br /><br />I loaded up some music and played it through this speaker and was pleased with the outcome. The speaker has no problem with playing at higher volume, without distortion or \\\\\\\\\"washing out\\\\\\\\\". The profile is very good too - the bass is strong and slightly elevated but not overkill, the midrange is very good and the music has depth as a result, and the highs are bright and crisp. For such a small speaker, this one produces better-than-expected sound.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite Bluetooth speakers. It is very small but it has excellent sound and is made very well. The size makes it placeable in areas where other speakers are too bulky to fit. This speaker proves that smaller speakers can have great sound and it\\'s worth its asking price.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at no cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it.er volume, without distortion or \\\\\\\\\"washing out\\\\\\\\\".

This speaker proves that smaller speakers can have great sound and it\\'s worth its asking price.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

              "  \"So, I wouldn't have purchased this if it were not for my wife, who is infinitely frustrated with my audio setup.<br /><br />I needed something that would sit next to our TV, and be simple to use.  The fact that this has a remote is a nice bonus.  The fact that this can grab my local radio stations is a HUGE bonus - one which I didn't know it could do (does it via streaming).<br /><br />My problem is that I have this setup:<br /><br />Computer requests audio to be played from a Linux computer which uses a M2Tech Hiface to stream digital to my DAC (streamed lossless FLAC).  This then feeds into my preamp, and then amp and speakers.  To access the linux computer that runs the whole show, I have to have her use shell login to my linux host (not easy for most people, and if something goes wrong, she can't fix it).  You can then  from command line play pandora or music.<br /><br />So, those issues being stated, after plenty of research, I chose this.  I can connect this up right into my preamp, and she can use it pretty easily.  The setup was a snap, follow a few instructions, and I'm now linked up with my pandora account (I've got probably 40 stations I've been grooming for years).  Great.<br /><br />I had mistook the &#34;antenna&#34; in the product pictures for a coax hookup for an AM/FM antenna.  In fact this hookup is for the antenna to your wireless router.  Very fortunately, this nice box has the great feature of being able to pickup any radio station that streams their broadcasts (which as it turns out, is almost all of the local stations).  Not only that, but I can get stations that I would otherwise not be able to get at all (since I don't rely on an antenna, just whatever I choose to stream).  how do I get my local stations?  Simple !  you just set your location (enter your city I believe).  And it'll select the right stations for where you are.  It will also allow you to then progress outwards and grab more stations that you wouldn't otherwise be able to get with an antenna of probably any size.  I live in Baltimore, and it allows me to get stations hundreds of miles away!  Very slick!!<br /><br />The one downside to this product is that the built-in amplifier is really pretty poor quality.  However, I didn't buy this for that functionality anyway.  I only ended up using it, as my preamp crapped out, and I'm stuck using the built in amp for the time being.  It's nice that it's available, but don't think that if you have decent speakers, that you'll get very good sound quality.  You're much better off using the 'line out' and putting this into your favorite receiver or preamp, as the built in one just isn't so great, but it's functional.ith an antenna of probably any size.

              "  \"[[VIDEOID:46129030a61a028dbd8e69c13b30606]] Please watch the video for more specifics.<br />I enjoyed using this Bluetooth speaker from TaoTronics.<br />You should wet the suction cup or else it will not stick very, once you do that you should be fine.<br />The audio is very clear the sound is very good overall but the bass may lack a little bit due to the size which is to be expected.<br />I found it interesting the typical double tapping of the phone button is not how you call the last caller, instead you must hold the button down which is different than what I'm used to but something worth noting.<br />It takes approximately two hours to charge after which you can expect 5-6 hours of playback from the 500mAh battery. When the battery is low it will beep to indicate that it's time for it to be recharged<br />The included user manual is very clear and very easy to read.<br />The charging ports is well covered so no issue there with water.<br />As you remember to wet the suction cup it will actually stick but if you do not it will probably only stick for a matter of minutes I found.<br />You can't submerged in water completely obviously but splashes here and there shouldn't be an issue.<br />Review sample provided free or at a discounted price for a fair, unbiased, and honest review.\",\n",

              "  '[[VIDEOID:ca7421903fd1ad5c64ae1dc42a160649]] Earbuds have always been an issue for me. Mine is one of those stereotypical stories -- I can\\'t find a pair that fits my ears well. I\\'ve tried so many types of earbuds and most of them give my ear canals some sort of fatigue. It\\'s not that they sound bad, just that keeping them in my ears for more than 10 minutes is painful. The only ones I could tolerate were the Apple EarPods, and I have a love/hate relationship with them. Sure, they sit nicely in my ears, but them being fully open means I lose my music to the crickets of night and pelicans of day. Well, no more! I found the Flare R2A in-ear monitors, and seems my fear of earbuds is over.<br /><br />Disclaimer: This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />The R2s began their life on Kickstarter with a campaign that raised over $170,000. That\\'s quite a lot for IEMs, which are a rather niche market. Flare is a British company that strives for excellence in sound, and hopes that the world can join them in this pursuit. Before the R2s, the company made loudspeakers, so in-ears is a bit of a different industry. I think they did a fine job of things.<br /><br />I listen to a lot of different genres of music, but mostly folk and dream pop lately. To test out the R2s, I listened to hip-hop, jazz, EDM, instrumental guitar and piano, rock, classical, and of course the aforementioned folk. They performed consistently well in every genre. They also look great.<br /><br />First, of course, the sound. These IEMs aren\\'t active noise canceling or anything fancy, which is good because noise canceling often diminishes the sound quality. The R2s are still great for keeping outside noises to a minimum. They use the same plushy foam tips as earplugs, which makes for a comfortable and quiet listening environment. I tried them at work, in the bus, walking down a busy road, and even in a studio while recording. There\\'s absolutely no sound leakage at all, which is great for quiet environments, and none of the quality seems to be lost when the environment is noisy.<br /><br />People sometimes rant about flat response and how it\\'s better than everything else. Those people might be troubled by the R2s. They\\'re warmer than most earbuds, but don\\'t have muddy bass. The main issue with earbuds is always treble: there\\'s way too much of it everywhere. Then Skullcandy wanted to have fun so they started adding a bunch of bass to the mix. Everything above 80Hz seemed to have been lost. The R2s have none of those problems -- highs are crisp, mids cut through well, and the lows of course deliver the much-needed punch, rather than a drone. The responsiveness of everything is very tight.<br /><br />As I said before, everything I listened to with these IEMs sounded wonderful. They revealed details in songs that I didn\\'t know were there, while also being comfortable, affordable, and easy to use. The highs were not overbearing, but pronounced; the high-mids don\\'t clutter the highs at all; the low-mids keep all the bass lines in check; and the lows make sure you remember that the bass drum exists without making you forget about the guitars in the mid-range. That\\'s a great achievement. I really love the way these sound. Everything is balanced. Overall, it\\'s a bit warm, but I would much rather it be warm than sound like tinny old Apple earbuds from the early 2000s, with their mesh and bass-less muddle.<br /><br />On to the design. These things are beautifully minimal, but aren\\'t trying to be artistic, which is nice for a change. The earbuds themselves are black (or whatever color you chose), and the tips and cable match that. There\\'s also a rectangular machined aluminum box that splits the stereo signal for the left and right channels. It doesn\\'t need to be as big as it is, but it does add some pizzazz to things. Lastly, there\\'s the 3.5mm connector, which on mine is black with two gold stripes running through it.<br /><br />I love the design, but there\\'s one ergonomic inconsistency: The aluminum box. It looks cool, and I can see why the designer would have put it there. However, if you want to use these as a versatile pair of IEMs, you may walk with them once in a while, or just move around a bit. The latter is inevitable, and when you do choose to move around you\\'ll hear some strange thudding sounds. That\\'s the box attempting to defy gravity. Every time I hear this I tell myself it\\'s cool to look at, but doesn\\'t need to be so heavy and certainly doesn\\'t add any special functionality. The heaviness, I suppose, adds value to the IEMs. I would just prefer it wasn\\'t here, especially when I\\'m using these to perform.<br /><br />While these are \\\\\\\\\"reference\\\\\\\\\" series -- at least according to the marketing by Flare -- I don\\'t recommend using them for referencing. The R2s don\\'t produce a completely flat sound like Sonys do. They\\'re amazing for listening to, but not necessarily for studio work. I tried mixing a few song using them just for fun, and I noticed that most of my mixes tended to lose the low-mid range on other speakers and headphones simply because the R2s are warm. This characteristic is great when listening to music, but not for mixing/producing it.<br /><br />If you\\'re a musician, you\\'ll find that these are great for monitoring (and thus they are named in-ear monitors). I used them to monitor my vocals and piano while recording an entire song and they worked great. The warmth helps make things less straining on the ears, and there\\'s not so much bass that I get a headache using them after a while. I also used these to monitor my synth and the rest of the band while playing live, and the foam tips isolated the sound very well.<br /><br />It\\'s worth noting that since these are in-ear monitors, there is no microphone. The aluminum block in the middle of the cable just acts as a splitter -- there\\'s no hidden microphone. At first this bugged me, because I would receive a call and forget I couldn\\'t use these headphones to talk. After a while, I just accepted it. There\\'s no reason for IEMs to have a microphone since there\\'s no way for you to use it as a talkback to your band or anything. It also goes against the way that Flare built these, which is to solely focus on recreating sound accurately, not adding more sound. Bottom line: A microphone would have been useful, but there isn\\'t one, and that shouldn\\'t be a deal breaker.<br /><br />Here\\'s the verdict: The R2s made me like earbuds again. I was considering the Shure SE215s, but these reign superior. Once they\\'re in my ears, I don\\'t feel like I need to take them out. They feel at home. Even Apple\\'s EarPods, which \\\\\\\\\"sit\\\\\\\\\" in my ears nicely, don\\'t make me forget that I\\'m listening to music through small pieces of plastic in my ears. The R2s do, and they don\\'t look ridiculous like some earbuds. My friend even told me he didn\\'t notice I was wearing them because they\\'re so small.

Both front and back of the device emit sound, though front is louder. I think this gives it better quality and more range. I use this out by the pool and plan on using for fishing trips and tailgates. The only reason i did not give it 5 stars, when pressing the volume +/- the music stops for a &#34;boop&#34; noise. Also, when powering on, changing modes, or pairing a device, the speaker plays a womens voice that sounds almost comical. It's a little goofy, but at this price point who cares. This speaker is comparable to high end units of the same size, with just slightly less bass.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon!\",\n",

The new ones are to power my cable box (Comcast) because even the briefest flicker of power and the box goes through the whole five minutes restart procedure.  The other one is just for the modem/router/VOIP/NAT devices.  We don't lose power very often or for very long periods of time but keeping all those devices from resetting and rebooting is worth the price of these inexpensive UPS devices (paid $45 each).

The two front receptacles are great when you work with a laptop in front of the rack and need to charge it, including your cell phone. I chose this version with and Amp meter, even though it still shows zero dot zero, but that's because I ended up plugging in very light applications like cable modem, IR repeater, USB fan, etc. Otherwise, if you plug in a hair dryer for testing purposes, you will start seeing the amps come up. So it does work, and very well. It is only a few inches deep. Few tips: always leave some space above or below the unit, so that if you plug in AC/DC adapters (those that come with small routers and modems), you will have enough clearance to plug the adapters in the back. Otherwise you can always buy those very short NEMA extensions to clear the path (http://www.amazon.com/C2G-Cables-03114-Outlet-Extension/dp/B0002J1KRQ/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1440983975&sr=8-4&keywords=nema+extension).

The sound is tinny, it has no automatic shutoff (a must for me), and the station tuning knob makes a huge change with only the slightest turn of the knob; that shortcoming drives me nuts. I use it only on camping and hunting trips to receive the Weather Service weather reports and as a backup for my Sangean AM/FM portable radio (love that one). I never could get it to work with the hand crank; maybe I am not doing something right. I have several other Midland products (CB, FRS, GMRS radios) and they are all pretty good but Midland fumbled the ball with this one.',\n",

              "  \"after a lightening strike wiped out my old receiver along with my music streaming devices (Grace and Roku) I was looking for an all in one 2 channel receiver that would stream internet radio, play Pandora type services and stream from my 400GB music database.  After researching on line, I bought this unit.<br /><br />It arrived today.  Set up was easy. It took longer un untangle the rats nest of old wires than to set up the new unit.  I connected my wired network and started to play around.  The sound quality is excellent!  The choices of inputs are excellent as well.  The one great shortcoming is the display panel.  I cannot understand why Yamaha would put 1980's technology into this otherwise modern, high quality system.  It has a one line 13 character dot matrix display for alpha numeric messages, such as track name, station id etc.  beyond me why they cut this corner.<br /><br />What saves the day is the app.  Yamaha NP Controller allows you to pretty much do everything from your android or iOS device.  The app is smooth, fast and intuitive.  Ps: do not download the Yamaha AV Controller App as it does not apply to this unit.\",\n",

Instructions are very basic, but it's easy tool free assembly means a 1 sheet instruction page is fine.<br /><br />As the shelves are adjustable to wherever you want them to go, you may have extra shelves leftover depending on how and where you place them on the poles.  As I migrate my DVD collection to Blu-Ray, I'll shrink the space between shelves and add the extras later.<br /><br />Overall, very pleased with this product at this price point.\",\n",

I did however get them to sound great with the use of the PowerAmp App on my phone, but for the most part, it is honest difficult to find a good spot with the equalizer and if using it with a device that has no PowerAmp app, it will continue to sound boomy. the highs and upper mids are much quieter in comparison. the ear hooks in my opinion are uncomfortable. I really wanted to like these headphones, but they were just too &#34;high Maintenance&#34;. I felt like I was working too hard to be happy with them, I want something that sounds and works good out of the box. the customer buys and uses, they don't work to make the product meet their expectations. for these reasons I decided to return and Went with the Jaybirds Bluebuds x. They are more Portable, come with a hardshell case in comparison to the cheap mesh bag included with the photives, feature better battery life, sound better, and are far more comfortable.

No bueno. It literally went bad on the 2nd listen!! I procrastinated calling the customer support number the headphones came with and eventually lost the little piece of paper, so I ended up buying a 3rd pair hoping the bad luck with the second was just a fluke.<br /><br />The 3rd pair lasted literally a week before - it too broke. Basically, only one of the headphones receives sound - regardless of what the headphones are plugged into. No matter if it's a computer, a phone or something else - only the headphone opposite of the mic works - which is quite inconvenient.<br /><br />To make matters worse - half the time the sound quality of the working headphone is horrendous. Overall, I really regret giving JLab another chance and buying from them. Their newer models just don't work.  Not sure what happened to the quality of their products, but it's crazy to have 2 different pairs of headphones stop working almost right away!<br /><br />Beware!\",\n",

I need to keep going back through the setup and then log back into pandora it is so much easier to put an old phone or cheap tablet in its place and the work soooo much better.  I wanted to get a large group of these one for the front one for the back and two or three in the house but at least the one I have is so spotty on its antenna I will not get and more of them.  Possibly if you are using it with a wired connection it would work great but my needs were to use the wifi and that is terrible.',\n",

              "  \"Here’s the quickie...<br /><br />1. Cool LCD screen that shows the status of all the batteries.<br />2. 4 cell charging is done with a time-share system where only 2 batteries are actually being charged at the same time.<br />3. It can charge LiFePO4!<br />4. Cooling is a bit of a problem (for in depth, read the whole review)<br />5. Overall this is a charger with a good warranty. If you got a flashlight or ecig that goes through batteries like a mad man, this is a good candidate.<br /><br />Full review:<br /><br />The looks:<br /><br />The Nitecore D4's outer appearance is quite amazing. The curves tapers off the edges leaving the charger with an elegant look and feel, not that you will be holding the D4 like a phone watching the bars slowly move up. Since when it is fully populated with 3400mah Panasonic 18650's this D4 becomes a brick, a charging brick?<br /><br />The usage:<br /><br />The D4 can charge pretty much any battery you can find, with the exception of the 9v. (I wish Nitecore made a 9v battery adapter...) For the lithium groups, you can either have it cut off at 4.20v for Lithium ions/IMR. Or if you have LiFePO4's you can have it cut off at 3.60v. The charger can't automatically detect a LiFePO4 from a Lion battery, but all you need to do is hold the mode button until it switches over to LiFePO4. FYI, Holding the MODE button also puts it into &quot;Low&quot; speed charging, but keep holding it and it will switch over it LiFe. For NiMH and NiCD batteries, the D4 uses delta Voltage and delta Time (-dV/dt on the LCD), the D4 measures the change in voltage over the change in time to detect when the battery is full.<br /><br />**********Charging 101**********<br /><br />Lithium batteries:<br /><br />When charging a lithium battery, you use a constant current (CC) to bring the cell to a voltage of 3.6v/4.2v/4.35v. When the max voltage is reached, the processor of the D4 will switch over to constant voltage (CV) and it will wait until the current drops below a certain amount. When that current is reached, the D4 cuts the power supply and it will show the &quot;Charging Finished&quot; icon. On this particular charger, it doesn't do a continued float charging where it keeps the batteries topped off. So that means if you leave the charger plugged in and powered, after 1 year the battery voltage will be lower than the charge voltage, but the charger will still say &quot;Charging Finished&quot;. The same goes for all &quot;common&quot; Lithium batteries in all shapes and sizes. Notice I wrote &quot;common&quot;, so no charging Lithium-Air or Lithium perchlorate batteries in the D4…<br /><br />Just FYI, Lithium batteries when over discharged will be damaged, because the cathode and anode of the battery will be destroyed and cannot be reverted back to its original state, thus losing capacity on a massive scale. Over charging Lithium batteries can be catastrophic, because the cell will heat up and go into thermal runaway. (When the battery self-destructs, like a diesel engine burning motor oil, runaway diesel). It’s quite fascinating how lithium batteries symbolize our own DNA. Every time they get charged, their “ends” are damaged a little bit losing capacity just like how our DNA loses its telomeres every time it replicate.<br /><br />For NiMH/NiCD batteries:<br /><br />The D4 uses a –Delta Voltage over Delta Time, or in English, the change in voltage over the change in time. So when the D4 receives a dead Eneloop AA for example, it will begin to supply power and take down notes of the time. It will also start a virtual graph with slopes, plotting down many voltage measurements along the time axis. So now you have a timer, memory, and a virtual graph. Seem quite complex just to charge a battery right? Without going too deep into the charging algorithm, let me finish off this off. When the processor detects a sudden drop of voltage at the terminals, the charger will terminate the charge and call it complete. Becauseof the close relationship of temperature and voltage in the chemistry of the battery, having a thermal sensor right under the battery is not necessary.<br /><br />**********END CHARGING 101**********<br /><br />The bads about the D4:<br /><br />The thermal design of this charger is horrific. Despite the time-share charging system, it still uses mosfets with close to none heat sinking. I had to make custom copper heat sinks and fill the whole charger with thermal pads. Although we are at a state in tech where even at 100C these PN junctions still operate happily for a while. But for long-term durability, the heat created is never good. I can safely say that the charger will last a good year or two, but with that amount of heat produced, you can question the efficiency of this charger. Granted, it only uses 12v 1amp, 12 watts, but it is only charging at 1400ma (750ma x2) @ 4.2v.<br /><br />Bottom-line is this charger is a must have, if you have Skyray kings or Supfire m6’s. Even their own TM06 uses 4x 18650s. I have had this charger for almost a month already. Gave me no problems, I have charged all my Eneloops and my whole collection of unprotected 18650’s, 32 of them!<br /><br />I this was a review that I wish everyone could write. I paid for the charger out of pocket, and I love it.e relationship of temperature and voltage in the chemistry of the battery, having a thermal sensor right under the battery is not necessary.<br /><br />**********END CHARGING 101**********<br /><br />The bads about the D4:<br /><br />The thermal design of this charger is horrific.

You have to dial in the minutes on a second knob and then hit a third button to execute. Other clock radios have a single button that you hit and forget.<br />3. The pre-select buttons are not lit, nor can you distinguish them by touch. Other clock radios have buttons and controls you can see or distinguish by touch in the dark.<br />In addition, my unit is finicky: (a) It gets lost trying to buffer the stations, all while my other mobile devices are having no problem getting wifi from the same location. (b) Either the power supply input jack or the start button fails. I fiddle with them and the device eventually turns on.<br />Finally, ten preset buttons is hardly enough.',\n",

I synced the headphones to my phone which was carried in a runner’s belt around my waist. My runs were usually an hour or 90 minutes. Besides the control box bouncing off my neck, these were the most reliable Bluetooth headphones I've used so far. The reason for my return is what happened the past two Sundays in a row. Both Sundays my runs were longer 2+ hours. Both times the headphones were fully charged the night before and both times the headphones battery died at exactly 2 hours. The description says 6+ hours listening time on a full charge. Clearly that's not true.

The product photo shows a series of tiny vertical relief cuts around the outer conductor of the MCX male connector that provides a kind of springiness that allows the male connector to flex slightly and then grab onto the internal components of the MCX female connector. Well, my pigtail was manufactured without those relief cuts. No amount of pressure will allow the male connector to be inserted in my NooElec RTL-SDR dongle, because there is no flex whatsoever. Needless to say, I am disappointed. Every photo of a MCX male plug that I've found online shows those relief cuts, so I assume they're part of the spec and this was just a massive screw-up by quality control. Maybe other people's MCX female ports have more flex to make up for it, but the plastic case of my RTL-SDR dongle won't even allow the rim of the male connector to pass. So now I'm stuck between drilling out the plastic case of the dongle and hoping for the best, or using some kind of tool to slice two vertical slits in the connector on the MCX male port.\",\n",

After approximately three months I purchased an additional one for my use.  My use is about the same as above with a Sumsung Rugby phone instead of an iPhone.  There has been no problem with any one or combination of devices.  I believe the iPad 4 has the highest current draw of all of the devices.  I have noted a 200mV drop in output voltage at approximately 2A load.  That of course is undesirable but within spec.  I spent to many years in power supply development to completely ignore that but also except it.  I think this product should meet the requirements of most users both for home and travel.

              "  \"These are amazing. I have always loved the portability and bass of my skull candy earbuds when you get a good seal but I have trouble getting the right fit. with the rubber tips it seems like the only way to get them to not fall out, while also getting good bass is too jam them into your ear pretty good and at that point, you have pushed out all the air and can feel almost like a suction that is putting tension of your eardrum. Not with these! I read about these while looking at the reviews for the Jaybirds Blue Buds X, I ended up ordering them along with a set of these, I can't tell you how happy I am with the setup. I don't even use the little wing tips or whatever you want to call them. roll these just like a normal foam earplug, and quickly place in a comfortable spot in your ear, hold for around 5-10 seconds and listen to your music. The highs are good and mids are good, and with the perfect seal you get with these foam ear tips, you get great heavy bass. but it is CLEAN. its not muddy, exaggerated, it is very present but in the cleanest way possible. Get the right fit and then head bang for an hour and I would be surprised if you managed to get them to fall out.\",\n",

Aiming directly at the towers, I got 0% signal, even without combining the antennas, mounting this directly on my mast.<br /><br />Customer support at Antennas Direct says the range is good for 35 miles MAX. If they had written that on the product description instead of the confusing &#34;25-50+ miles&#34;, I probably wouldn't have spent my whole afternoon on the roof.<br /><br />This is a great solution if you're looking to add short range VHF to your signal downlead. Watch out for medium or long range, it might not work. It's just a pair of dipoles. If you have line of sight, you might be ok on longer range\",\n",

I think this is more like $29.99).<br />b) it didn't really charge my phone that fast.

No nonsense loud voices telling if you're connected or not (finally!!) and the sound is outstanding considering the size of this item. I use it mainly in my car to listen to lectures and occasionally some music too. One thing that could be improved is the loudness although as is it fits the bill quite well. Where this thing impressed me the most though, is with its outstanding speakerphone capability. Not one complain yet from anyone I've spoken to through this little gizmo and that for me was a real deciding factor as tons of little BT speakers have as loud or louder a sound, long lasting battery, yadi yada...but their speakerphone in general mostly stink at best...this guy however pulls it off nearly as well as my way more expensive Sony SRS X3!!<br />Cool design and colors BTW. Battery lasts quite many hours. Have not timed it but 6-7 hours minimum I'd say.<br />Charges pretty fast too.<br />READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!!! Most reviewers are complaining about loosing the BT connection settings after turning it off. Some even mention the ridiculously long time it takes to shut it down lol.<br />Once paired if you click the on/off button just once for a short second OR LESS the speaker will alternate between the on and off mode and go in standby mode. If you hold the button for a few seconds then a complete shutdown happens and therefore the connection settings may be lost. This in fact is a very welcome and refreshing function (like my Sony SRS X3) as holding the button down for a stupid amount of time is what's required on most low to mid end BT speakers and I personally can't stand it. It's unnecessary and annoying. This one, one quick click it's off, one quick click and it's on... And remember, NO annoying voices either....I love that! Essentially a very well engineered piece of electronics. Btw it does mentioned being engineers in the USA and made in China. I'm not surprised by the results especially the speakerphone function (can't stress its usefulness enough).<br />Anyways, read the instructions and enjoy this remarkable and recommendable BT speaker.<br />I'm probably gonna purchase a couple more for the price they sell.<br />I absolutely and easily recommend this item.\",\n",

              "  'The TaoTronics Model TT-SK08 is a rugged looking, waterproof, outdoor Bluetooth speaker. It comes in an attractive box, which includes a manual in several languages, a USB charger cable, an audio cable, but no charger. You have to use the USB charger included with your phone, tablet or use the one on your computer.<br />The speaker comes with a built-in rechargeable battery. It is not clear whether the battery can be replaced - perhaps by unscrewing the cover on the speaker. There is no indicator on the speaker of how much battery life is left. But an interesting feature is that next to the bluetooth icon on my iPhone/iPad there is a battery charge level indicator for the speaker. Advertised play time is pretty long but I did not verify.<br /><br />The speaker uses the newer Bluetooth 4 standard. Volume changes on device and speaker are in sync, which is a lot more convenient. However, the volume buttons do not have a second function to skip forward/backward like they have on<br />Taotronics other models.<br /><br />You can pair more than one Bluetooth device with the speakers. However, the manual does not list how many devices can be paired with speaker.<br /><br />The bluetooth range is great and covers at least 30ft plus. Keep in mind that this is a Mono speaker. I would not call this speaker bidirectional since most of the sound is coming out the front. I believe the Bass is supposed to come out of the back Sound is a bit thin but quite acceptable for a speaker of this size and prize, and definitely loud enough across the room.<br /><br />The speaker has a microphone and can therefore be used as a speaker phone. The speaker plays the ring tone of your phone. A conversation on the phone was loud and clear and the microphone worked fine.<br /><br />The speaker can be put on a flat surface, has a large rubber handle and a tripod screw underneath. The rubberized covering looks strong and sturdy. I did not test how waterproof the speaker is.<br /><br />Overall a great outdoor speaker, great packaging, easy to read manual with clear contact information. A suggestion would be to include a travel pouch since you may want to throw this speaker in a beach bag or hiking backpack.',\n",

              "  \"It works!  We recently bought a Samsung Blu-Ray player as a gift for my son-in-law and his sweetie.  Their flat screen had so-so built-in speakers and their old skool receiver had no HDMI inputs, just stereo RCA analog audio inputs.  I purchased this unit and ALSO purchased this cable [[ASIN:B0002J2B8I C2G / Cables To Go 29115 Velocity S/PDIF Digital Audio Coax Cable (6 Feet)]] .  When we hooked it up it immediately worked.  Audio content from movies sounds good, clear.  Sound is in sync with the picture.  Now their setup has some real bass and oomph.  This will be a solution for them until they can afford a modern 7.1 surround receiver/speaker setup.  Note:  We went into the Blu-Ray player's audio settings and confirmed that PCM was set as the default.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - CAVEATS, TECHNICAL ADVICE:  Caveat 1:  This only produces stereo output (Left and Right analog audio jacks).  In the setting of your Blu-Ray player:  You ** have ** to use PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) output setting if you want this to work right  -- it specifies that right on the box.  Now, some people may have an older receiver that would have a feature to synthesize surround for a 5.1 system but usually, if you have that feature available to you, then one would &#34;tend to&#34; also have HDMI inputs on their receiver.  If you have HDMI inputs on your audio receiver... why bother?  This is a work around for those who don't.  IF your receiver has HDMI inputs, the high likelihood is that you don't need this.  IF your receiver has HDMI inputs and you aren't getting audio output 1. Check your settings and the sequence in which you turn components on  (I find that turning on my plasma TV before turning on my receiver works better).  2.  You might need to find an HDMI cable that specifies it has &#34;audio return&#34;.  All that being said, if you need this kind of workaround solution to deliver an analog feed an older sound system, then  ---&#62; running your Blu-Ray player's sound output through a decent stereo's analog inputs using this interface conversion box beats the pants off using the the wimpy speakers in most TVs.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  Caveat 2:  OREI DOES ** NOT ** GIVE YOU A NON-OPTICAL (i.e. copper wire) CABLE ...which I believe will be the solution most people actually want.  YOU HAVE TO PURCHASE ONE SEPARATELY.  I strongly recommend buying a specifically &#34;Digital&#34; cable, labeled as being meant for SPDIF (Sony/Panasonic Digital Interface) like in the link I mentioned above - they run 5 - 10 dollars.  If you try using a conventional RCA analog audio cable the digital signal may corrupt or the sound could stutter, especially over longer cable lengths.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  Caveat 3:  I suppose there may be some Blu-Ray players out there that, for cost cutting purposes, have omitted the SPDIF connector that looks like a single RCA jack.  In which case this product would not be a solution you could use.  Final note:  This unit also comes with an optical connector interface and a probably 3 ft optical cable.  I did not use that feature or test it so cannot speak to how well it works.  You * could * run the blu-ray player's HDMI cable to your flat screen and then, IF it had an optical out, use the supplied optical cable to this OREI box and then run RCA analog cables to your stereo.  The big unknown is:  Will the audio output &#34;lag&#34; or stay in sync with your TV?  Sometimes you can set video / sound delay in your TV.  You'd just have to test.  Again, if your receiver has HDMI built in, there is usually no need to use this kind of product.\",\n",

              "  'I received this cable on August 25, 2015.  I had purchased it for use in a hifi system along with a Wharfedale 8&#34; subwoofer.  I had read good things, but I was still surprised by the quality of this cable when it arrived.  I also use BlueRigger HDMI cables, and I am very happy with those, so I bought this as well.  It is a very thick, dual shielded cable, and the ends are gold plated and fit snugly with no play.  It was exactly what I needed.  Bass was crisp and clear, no hum or interference.  I ended up replacing this with a MediaBridge cable because I discovered that if I used a cable with a split mono lead, I could get a bit more input level and a noticeable gain in output.  I wish that BlueRigger made a split mono version.  I briefly considered buying a small splitter adapter and a second one of these because of how nice it is, but the cost would have been too high.  If your subwoofer uses a crossover that only requires a single RCA connection, then this is the cable to get.  If you can get a bit more level using a splitter, or a split mono cable, then go that route because there is a noticeable difference.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Thick, high quality cable<br />-Gold plated ends<br />-Snug fitting<br />-No hum or interference (dual shielded)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Not offered in a split mono version<br /><br />All in all, I will be using more BlueRigger products in the future and I look forward to seeing their line expand. I rate this cable at 5/5 stars and highly recommend BlueRigger products.  For the cost vs. quality this is easily one of the best brands on Amazon.',\n",

I really like it, gotta love anythings that's pretty to look at. As far as the performance, since it comes with a 16 GB Micro SD card, it holds a TON of songs. You can replace the SD card in this player, however you can not expand it. 16 GB is the maximum that it can handle, so that is something to keep in mind. I love filling mine up if I am taking a day trip and don't want to risk losing my more expensive players. This is perfect for that.<br /><br />It is plug and play for the most part, though if you are trying to follow the included instructions I found them to be a bit confusing.

We really enjoyed watching the lights on the color display however after further research my boyfriend decided the JBL Charge 2 plus was more practical for him. He will be using the speaker at work in an outside environment and it is better for outdoor use, there are 2 subs on the end so it provides a better base sound. The charge 2 can charge your phone and allow up to 3 bluetooth devices to be connected vs. the JBL Pulse which will only allow one.<br /><br />Overall if you are looking for a cool light display the JBL Pulse might be for you, but if you are looking for more practicality and versatility I would recommend the JBL Charge 2.',\n",

Sound is more full and bass is richer.<br />Wish I had got these sooner.\",\n",

Though, it seemed like I would have to sacrifice one or the other, I was going to get an unlocked smart phone until I came across this guy. It's not perfect, however, I rate it 5 stars for what you get for $100. Don't be fooled either, It is an amazing player that I believe is more favorable over an iPod Classic and other expensive Hi-Res Players.<br />At first glance, It looks like a knock-off of a smaller version of an iPod Classic which greets you with an expeditious boot-up and on to the main screen that will throw you off a bit. It's easy to navigate using the mechanical jog wheel which feels sturdy and has minimal leeway. The settings are simple to understand and has tech manual included if you decide you need to use it after you've thrown it out. The chassis feels solid even with the plastic back panel and comes with a silicone case too if you're feeling skeptical. The battery is long lasting (approximately 11 hours) and has a micro USB jack to charge it.<br />There are two types of ways to view your music: File Mode and Category Mode. In File Mode, It will appear exactly how you arrange your files or music on your removable drive window on your computer which allows users to customize and organize their music listings, for example, I sorted my music by Artist &#62; Album &#62; Songs. This will require some time and can be fixed by updating your files in settings which will automatically designate your music based on the files' detailed information under Category Mode. The only drawback to Category Mode, which I believe is the only major drawback, is that you can only store 5800 songs in Category Mode yet you can have as many songs as your MicroSD card can fit under File Mode.<br />Some of the user interface abilities could have been improved but unfortunately, Fiio has stopped making updates for the X1 and will soon be replaced by the X3 Next Generation. All in all, this player has exceeded my expectation and I will try out some lose-less music to see the true potential of the X1.\",\n",

I purchased the product to experiment and provide that detail in one review. Overall this product DID bring out additional detail when viewed up close, it was just not noticeable from the location where we watch the TV in 2D or 3D. This is why I have given it an &#34;OK&#34; rating. We sit approximately 11 feet away from the TV in a completely dark room directly in front of the TV (No angle). I didn't really notice any difference until I was 2 feet away from the front of the TV.  The unit has a test mode where one half of the picture has been clarified and the other half has not, for your comparison. We primarily watch movies in Blu-ray or up-converted DVD's and all my equipment is Samsung. (TV has been setup to provide optimum color and clarity. (Not setup with factory default settings). TV Model Number: PN64D550C1F. Blu-ray player Model number is HT-D550). I also tried it on our cable input to see if that made much of a difference. It did not. Again, from our viewing position, we sit too far away for it to provide any noticeable improvement in clarity.<br />To sum up, it works as defined but really did not provide us with a better viewing experience for the size and type of TV based on the viewing distance we watch from. This unit is somewhat expensive and I would not recommend its purchase for TV's of my size and type or smaller.  I think it is really designed for very large screen projector style TV's.\",\n",

              "  \"[[ASIN:B003EM800S Panasonic RPHJE120S In-Ear Headphone, Silver]]<br /><br />I have been using these Panasonics for over a year now.  For me, they are still the biggest bang for the buck.  I thought I lost my last pair so I decided to &#34;splurge&#34; and pay twice the price for these SoundMAGICs as I heard great things.  There are reviews that specifically compares my Panasonics to the ES18s where great majority states that ES18s are the clear winner.<br /><br />For me, however, it isn't all that clear.  Perhaps from sound quality alone that may be the case but the nominal gains you get in sound quality can be negated by some of the other factors that I considered.<br /><br />I found my set of Panasonics after I received the ES18 which allowed me to conduct a side by side comparison. Some notes about the comparison:<br />- I am not an audiophile but I do appreciate a good set of headphones.  Let's just say that I'm willing to pay up to $20 for a good set.<br />- Used the ES18 for a few days before comparing to allow burn in period (~60 hrs).<br />- Same music and videos were used on iPad Mini and iPhone 5.  I switched the two earphones back and forth between the two devices to make sure that there wasn't a sound difference from device source.  There wasn't.  I had one set in one ear and the other set in other ear at the same time (but this actually made it harder to tell the difference between the two).<br /><br />What I found in order of personal importance:<br /><br />Sound quality winner: SoundMAGIC ES18<br />Both delivers good bass for such affordable sets.  Online sources say the ES18's bass is superior.  I couldn't tell and must call that a draw.  The lowest lows from both sets seemed near equal.  Both had that headbobbing thump that makes listening to them enjoyable.  Where the ES18 wins is the mid's.  My slight criticism of the Panasonics is that the mid's do seem a bit flat making the ES18 seem more balanced.  I can also hear more detail in the ES18.  And because the more balanced approach, voice clarity is better on the ES18 also.  At first I thought that the Panasonics had better bass but it's because it seems to &#34;push&#34; the lows (making the lower range louder) but in reality the absolute lows of both sets were fairly, and near equally, deep.  Some may prefer the Panasonic's over-emphasis on the low end.  So the ES18 has better sound because of the balance, more mid, overall detail and voice clarity.  How much more did I enjoy the ES18 in terms of sound quality?  In a completely subjective term: a little.  Yes, there is a clear difference on HOW they sound but it took me a couple hours of going back and forth to ultimately say I ENJOY the sound of ES18 more.<br /><br />Comfort and design winner:  Panasonic RPHJE120<br />This one was absolutely clear to me as soon as I put on the ES18.  The Panasonic's &#34;Ergo-fit&#34; design has the offset ear insert and a flat surface to lay in the flat spot next to the ear hole.  Not only does the Ergo-fit design make it more comfy, it allows a more secure fit.  The ear insert itself on the Panasonics is smaller probably due to the smaller driver size (9mm vs. 10mm).  While neither are heavy, you can tell the weight of the ES18 is higher (again, probably due to the larger driver size).  Also, the Panasonic's shape doesn't protrude out of the ear as much as the ES18.  You could almost side sleep with the Panasonics on.<br /><br />Other design consideration is the discerning between the left and and the right insert.  The Panasonic's design is distinct to which ear insert belongs to which side of the ear (due to the flat surface as part of the Ergo-fit design).  You'll be able to understand and see from a distance which insert belongs to which ear within seconds of ownership.  The ES18, on the other hand, is symmetric in design.  There is a tiny little &#34;R&#34; at the cord stem for the right side but it's impossible to see in low lighting.  I now go by the &#34;ES18&#34; written on the right insert.  The left side does not have a &#34;L&#34; but I know now that the left insert has SoundMAGIC's insignia on that side.  The point is, you can tell the left and right on the Panny's easily but you'll have see up close to discern on the ES18.<br /><br />Cord material winner:  SoundMAGIC ES18<br />Another no brainer.  The Panny's thin cord allows it to get tangled easily.  I like the heft that the ES18's cord has that resist tangling.  I'm spending anywhere between 10 seconds to a minute untangling or unknotting the Panny's cord everytime I take it out of my gym bag.  Haven't done once with ES18.  While this may not seem like a big deal, I've had more &#34;Not again!&#34; moments when I took the Panasonics out of my bag than I'd care for.<br /><br />Cost winner:  Panasonic RPHJE120<br />At around six bucks, less than half price of the ES18.<br /><br />To say which I like more is tough to answer when you factor in cost and comfort.  I give both 5 stars.  Yes I do think the ES18 sounds better but I still quite enjoy the Panasonic's sound.  What you get for the money on either is extraordinary.  Those that appreciate a balanced approach and have a more critical ear should look into the ES18.  Those that just want something better than the cruddy stock earbuds that came with your mobile device can't go wrong with the $6 Panasonics.<br /><br />UPDATE 10/1/15:<br />There is an L indicating the left ear piece.  I missed that initially.  Just proves how hard it is to see the L and R indicators.  I placed a little strip of red tape on the right ear piece so I can easily tell the difference.<br /><br />I find myself reaching for the ES18 over the Panasonics when side-by-side as I do enjoy the sound of these more when I want to rock out. The bass has a better impact as you can hear both the sub-bass and mid-bass while the Panny's bass seem blended together.  The sound stage is another significant difference where the ES18 sound much more open.  The Panny's sound like listening to loud speakers in a small enclosed room compared to these.  There's so much debate in the online universe about which value IEMs have the best sound stage presentation (i.e. Brainwavz Delta and now Jive, Xiaomi Pistons, Phillips SHE3590, SoundSoul products, MEE products) but I think these ES18's do a very good job and, generally in the online community, are well regarded.  Man, I'm still dizzy from trying to decipher online what is the best value IEM.  There's so many out there in the $5-$25 range that's rated well.  I guess that's a win for us value consumers.  The biggest concensus knock against the ES18 I found online is that the treble is rolled off and lacks the sizzle that some prefer.  I'm ok with it as I don't want anything piercing.<br /><br />My biggest personal gripe is that the bass is nonexistent at moderate to low volume so I do prefer the Panny's when I'm in a mellow mood.  The Panny's still have a good thump at lower volumes.  The ES18's bass presence is hugely dependent on volume and without that presence, it completely lacks depth.  I didn't see many complaints about this online so I'm wondering if it's an issue with my set or am I the only one who cares?  I'm going to assume the latter as the set works just fine otherwise.  And because of the bass-volume dependency, the ES18's lose versatility.  I'm one of those that listen to all kinds of music so the lack of versatility is somewhat disappointing.  I'm glad to have both in the end.  I'll probably use these 4 of 5 times and use the Panny's for the remainder for sit down listening.  It's Panny's all the way for working out due to the more comfortable and secure fit.<br /><br />Added note:  I'm now a proud owner of the Panasonic TCM125's (down to $9 here on Amazon!), the RPHJE120 equivalent with mic and remote.  Gave the 120's to the GF who lost her stock buds.  Now I can answer calls during workout without having to pull phone out of pocket.  Some say the 125's soundbetter and some say the 120's sound better (CNET says latter).  I went back and forth after burning in the 125's.  I cannot tell a difference.  To me it's the same darn thing; it's just a matter of paying extra $3 to get the mic/remote.<br /><br />One thing I will say is that both Panny's can get much louder than the ES18.  It may be a matter of impedence and/or sensitivity.  I think the highest volume for the ES18 will be more than enough for the average listener but not for those that want it super loud.s have the best sound stage presentation (i.e. Brainwavz Delta and now Jive, Xiaomi Pistons, Phillips SHE3590, SoundSoul products, MEE products) but I think these ES18's do a very good job and, generally in the online community, are well regarded.

              "  \"It's a solid cable, well designed.  My only caveat, though it's a big one, is that it's remote functionality is non-existent on my device.. The volume control & answer call button are guaranteed to work with ALL Samsung designed Android devices, but I have a Droid Turbo.  From reading other reviews, it's a crop-shoot as to the level of functionality it may have with your android device.  I've had my Momentums for 2 years now, & this cable makes them sound great again, better than new in fact as it is true high-end headphones sound better with age!!  Also, notice the end of the cable you plug in, the &#34;low-profile angled plug&#34;; it has been redesigned as to decrease it's chance of breaking off or getting in the way of things.  Wanted to give 5 stars, but cannot for the reason aforementioned.  I hope Sennheiser releases a more universally compatible remote cable such as this in future, though the blame may be more on the device manufacturer side... Motorola!\",\n",

However the audio will cut out here and there very so often.For under $15 the pair is ok for music. I do not recommend it for more than that price and I do not recommend it for video playback as the cheaper chipset inside loses slight connection even in clear line of sight to the bluetooth source and your video goes out of audio sync and that ruins it as a video playback bluetooth headset. Its mostly made of cheaply put together plastic so durability is not the greatest but its good enough if you take care and caution when putting then back in your backpack or purse etc. The fit is good and they say put for the most part, even though the wing tips that come with them are pretty much useless as they do not give a tight secure fit like many of the other more expensive bluetooth headsets do. I do not think they will be very sweat resistant so if you are a heavy sweater you may want to look elsewhere. However I cannot say for sure bc I do not not sweat a lot and even though its a cheap plastic build they do have the slightest of separation from your ear in that its hard to get actual drops of sweat on them unless you have longer hair and its wet or again are a real heavy sweater or runner etc.<br /><br />There are many generic branded versions of this headset (Mpow, iclever etc) and some are a little better with a better chipset and have aptx certification (supposedly, and its supposedly supposed to be better more CD like quality sound) so the filesonic version of this headset is the cheaper version but it sounds good enough for everyday or gym use. Im no audiophile and sound is subjective, but its good enough for me and on par with many other sets I have. I can only tell a slight decrease in quality vs the aptx certified version I also have but its so slight that Im sure only audiophiles can tell the difference.<br /><br />Overall I would recommended them for about $15 bucks or cheaper and pretty much for music only use and possibly the gym if you are not a runner or heavy sweater.br />Overall I would recommended them for about $15 bucks or cheaper and pretty much for music only use and possibly the gym if you are not a runner or heavy sweater.',\n",

I decided to upgrade because I wanted a receiver that does Dolby Atmos and DTS:X and also has HDMI 2.0a: and HDCP 2.2 support.  There have been many improvements over the last five years which have been incorporated into the receiver.  (Too many to mention.)  It plays louder, has a smoother, more balanced sound, and seems to run cooler than my old unit.  It took about thirty minutes to get everything set up including a basic calibration.  ( I'm coming from a previous Yamaha receiver so I knew what to expect, but the quick set-up guide makes it pretty simple to get started for people not used to the Yamaha brand.)  Forgot to add :  The standard antennae-connected radio works great.  (Something my previous Yamaha 2000 did poorly.)  The Internet radio is also performing superbly.\",\n",

What I dislike is the charging cable is not a standard USB micro, but a barrel connector type that is not easily replaced if the one that ships with this is lost or damaged. I subtracted a star from the rating because of that issue.<br /><br />The sound quality is more than acceptable considering the price and size of this speaker. The high, mid and low frequencies are nicely reproduced and the highs are not shrill. No, it isn't audiophile quality, but it is good enough for casual listening. Plus it's a LOT better than the internal speakers in my phone, tablets or even my laptop.<br /><br />If you have a non-bluetooth device (and there are surprisingly many tablets in this day and age that are not equipped with bluetooth) this speaker is an inexpensive solution.\",\n",

With that experience, I bought this sound bar for an apartment living and this is truly the biggest failure and the worst decisions I have ever made. Many of my friends started looking for sound bars,since I already bought this piece, they started asking me for my review and I suggested them to go look for some other brand except HK. So one of my friend ended buying  Bose and other one ended up buying Sonos. The moment I heard those systems,both of them have completely thrown me off and I liked Sonos the most.<br /><br />Second  biggest UPSET, CUSTOMER SERVICE. I have never expected from HK having such a sloppy and nasty customer service. This is my last visit to HK and I will never buy nor recommend any of my friends buying HK products.<br /><br />You have to take a serious action pretty soon and failure in doing so will lead to RIP HK......<br /><br />GOOD BY FOR EVER........',\n",

I took this out of the box, plugged it up, charged it, and then turned it on.  One I figured out how to use it, I decided it was best to just let her use the FM Radio part of the player and then I would put music on it at a later point.  She played with it for about an hour maybe two, and it needed to be charged again.  The problem is , it won't charge!  I have no idea why it won't charge now, as it charged when I first got it.  But it won't.  I was really disappointed in it.  Please know that everything that I have written about this product is how I really feel about it and you can read my reviews with confidence.

              "  \"These are great headphones, I did a lot of searching and even sent back some Seinheisers that didn't have what I was looking for. Let me make one thing clear, the quality of this headphone can be replicated by cheaper headphones, BUT... not if you amp them. I went 2 months without an amp and they were great, dug real low on movies with bass and, well there are other reviews about the awesome sound but frankly it's a flat EQ (which was done on purpose and is a good thing) but I bought them for their bass capabilities not for their ability to replicate audio without 'tarnishing' it. I used a Fiio E17k and these things WOKE UP. You can adjust the bass, treble, and whatnot to remain flat and even then these things sound better. Add +4 or +6 to the bass EQ though and these are FUN.<br />  Some people mention that when you get high end headphones like these and an amp it just makes bad music stick out more, it is unfortunately very true. I can immediately tell which tracks on my ipod or on Youtube were downloaded at low quality, it's painful to listen to... but it's completely worth it when you find good HQ tracks because these babies put you in the studio. Bass guitars have concert like depth, highs are not shrill, the amp completely brings back the mids that some people have complained about not being up to par, and if you throw on techno/trap/rap ... if you're into that sort of thing... the D600s are thrilling. ss...<br />  Long story short, these are great by themselves, but if you want to actually experience them the way they are meant to be experienced, and have some hard hitting (not distorted or overbearing) bass- GET THEM with an AMP!!!!<br />Sidenote, I almost didn't buy these because of a negative review about the headband being uncomfortable, but I have a buzzcut, a normal sized/shaped head ( I think ) and I have these on for hours at a time with no trouble. They are in fact extremely comfortable and I've never had to take them off out of annoyance.\",\n",

              "  \"Last year, I finally transitioned to a flat screen TV.  It wasn't new, but it was new to me.  Until then, I wasn't really sure what all of the whole HDMI thing was about.  It just looks like a fatter USB plug if you don't have HDMI.  Imagine my surprise when my older electronics also needed to be replaced with newer ones and they all required or suggested an HDMI connection.  That's great, if your TV has more than one HDMI port!<br /><br />My older TV works beautifully, so I couldn't justify buying another TV just to get more HDMI ports.  After looking around, I found several brands of multi-port HDMI plug and play units.  I decided on the HausBell 3-Port High Speed HDMI Switch 3-In-1-Out (Hdmi V1.3) Intelligent 1080P AC Power adapter.<br /><br />I was nervous about setting this up, but it was easy and fast.  It literally took about 2 minutes from the time I took it out of the package until I was watching TV using the HausBell 3-Port High Speed HDMI Switch 3-In-1-Out Intelligent 1080P AC Power adapter.  I plugged my Apple TV into the adapter and the adapter into the back of my TV.  I switched the TV and Apple TV back on but the Apple TV didn't switch on.  I moved the Apple TV to the second port on the adapter and it was fully functional.<br /><br />The picture quality is as good as it was when I had the Apple TV connected directly to the TV.  I may now brave up and hook up the DVD player next.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided with a free or discounted product in order to review this item. However, this did not influence my review.

If that happens, the tie won't tighten and you have to start over with a new one.<br />- Amazon sells a tensioning tool for these ties. I purchased it and save your money. To tighten, I used a pair of wire clippers and a flat head screwdriver. Manually tighten the tie until you can't tighten any more. Clamp the wire clippers on the extra length of tie near the ball bearing housing. Take your flat head, rest against the wire clippers, and gently push the ball bearing housing further up the tie. Snipe off the excess tie.<br />- It has been over a month and none of the ties have loosened.\",\n",

Not only do many commercial stations have an Internet feed, but many Internet only stations exist some of which are commercial free.<br /><br />For us, the chief joy of this device over the old tech which only receives local signals is that we can get stations from all over the world. This allows us to listen to shows we could never expect to get locally plus we listen Internationally. Those guys in Zimbabwe really rock out. Once you try this, you'll see how limited regular radio - even subscriber radio such as Sirius - is.<br /><br />Let me say this: if you think the news is reflected by the US outlets such as CNN, Fox, MSHAHA or whatever, you are missing a lot.<br /><br />This is a huge heavy device with a relatively small non-touch screen. Setup isn't difficult except make sure your ISP opens Port 80 before you start. This is usually closed by default. Once online, you register your unit with Grace and you're off and running.<br /><br />The sound is decent if not great. There is a built in equalizer if you want to make your own output bias so the complaints here about lack of bass are, to me, baseless. Boost the bass if you want.<br /><br />We have ours hooked to a pair of JBL speakers through a homemade little 20w amp which makes the sound quite nice. You can get such amps for less than $20 from all the usual suspects.<br /><br />The device comes complete to hook into a few services notably Pandora. Browsing through the huge selections of Internet stations is daunting using the radio itself. This is made much easier using the iOS or Android (Windows phones don't apply) app available for free at the usual outlets.<br /><br />We use iOS here and found the app to be sluggish and annoying on two iPhone 6's but quite useful on iPads G3 and G5. Programming presets and browsing the Internet is so much easier using the app that I doubt one would much enjoy this device having to navigate by relying on the small screen located in the radio. The remote works well but is limited to LOS being infrared.<br /><br />I'd really like to have seen a larger screen located on top of the unit which is touch capable and the addition of Bluetooth. It does have a headphone output but wired only. Yes, I can get a Bluetooth adapter to fit the 3.5 mm headphone jack but today Bluetooth is pretty common.<br /><br />Overall we're highly pleased with our purchase and would surely do it again.vice having to navigate by relying on the small screen located in the radio.

              "  \"The Sangean ANT-60 antenna is good for what it is and performs as it should. One came packed with my excellent Sangean ATS-909X multiband radio. What is it? ANT-60 is a 23' random wire antenna that reels into a spool like a measuring tape. That makes it easy to pack and carry around. It has a 3.5mm plug that fits into the external antenna socket on many portable shortwave radios. This plug is the same as a 1/8&#34; mono audio plug available as an electronics part from electronics stores like Radio Shack. The ANT-60 includes an alligator clip adaptor that allows the user to connect the ANT-60 center plug pin to the whip antenna of radios that do not feature an external 3.5mm-1/8&#34;antenna jack. ANT-60 also includes a strap and clip for hanging the far end of the antenna. ANT-60 is nice as a portable antenna for temporary setups. I pack mine when traveling or when using the radio on the boat.  A random wire antenna will provide useful signal gain over a built-in telescopic whip SW antenna if the wire is long enough for the frequency to be received. The ANT-60 is long enough to provide excellent gain for SW frequencies over 12.0 MHz. For frequencies lower than that don't expect quite as much gain. For an example from my location nnear the US west coast, Radio Australia at 17.840 MHz late afternoons and evenings comes in two or three times stronger with ANT-60 compared to using the built-in whip antenna on the Sangean ATS-909X. But, listening to Radio Havana Cuba during the evening at the lower frequency of 6.100 MHz may only be 50% to two times stronger with ANT-60 compared to the whip antenna. The ANT-60 doesn't do quite as well at lower frequencies due to it's relatively short length. The built-in ferrite bar antennas found on most multi-band portables will do a better job for AM band (MW) radio which is much lower in frequency than SW. ANT-60 works best with SW.   The ANT-60 antenna should be hung horizontally and as high off the ground as convenient. Six to eightfeet off the ground will do fine. The direction isn't that critical at this low height off the ground. No need to string it up tightly, a little sag in the wire won't hurt. Random wire antennas work best if you use them outdoors. They can work well inside wooden framed houses. You can also use a random wire antenna indoors by running most of the wire outdoors through a window or doorway.  ANT-60 may be purchased for under $15 and sometimes for under $10. Keep in mind that for $25 you can buy 75' or more of 18 gauge insulated copper wire, a 1/8&#34; mono audio plug and some mounting hardware and have a permanent random wire antenna that will run circles around the ANT-60 at all SW frequencies down to 3.0 MHz and maybe below that. I use a 120' random wire at home mounted eight feet off the ground. That antenna rocks.  Keep in mind that quite a few user/reviewers and blog reviewers of short wave gear do not understand shortwave radio very well. SW reception is always better with outdoor antennas. Areas located in &#34;the boonies&#34; often offer the best reception of all because they are located away from electronic devices that cause RFI (radio frequency interference) with shortwave receivers. Those new to shortwave may also not understand that certain times of day offer better shortwave reception than others and that most shortwave bands work better at certain times of day than others. Inexpensive portable shortwave radios priced under $150 are likely to offer performance that is limited, at best. Cheap radios often rely too much on amplified antenna gain from a whip antenna and may overload if a longer external antenna like ANT-60 is attached.  For well-designed shortwave radios (portable or tabletop) the ANT-60 will work better than a built-in whip antenna. The reel-up feature is a nice convenience.\",\n",

And they're 35 bucks. My challenge to the brand shoppers like me, the next time your 100.00 plus headphones go down, do yourself a favor and try these. They fit well, they really are &#34;no tangle&#34;, the zip concept is great, and of course the most important part, the sound... the dynamics are very good. The base thumps, and honestly, the mid range to highs are better than the Bose. Heck I can get 3 pairs of these and get change back or 1 pair of the Bose. Now that I know how good they are, I'll probably get another color too. FOLKS, TRY THESE HEADPHONES. You can pay more, but you'll be hard pressed to get a better headphone.\",\n",

I will eventually put HDMI through my walls and just use this as a spare long cable as needed for connecting a laptop, setting a TV outside, and other temporary uses.<br /><br />UPDATE - I increased my review from 4 to 5 stars because really the cables are great and very rugged, which is why they may not be as flexible as other cables.

Using this on a pontoon boat, and even when just floating the people in the front cant hear it good.<br />2, you cant pair more than 1 of these to a device at a time! Even with my kids crappy little dollar store specials he can run 3 of them simultaneously.

Only problem for me: I was looking for an extension cord with a very thin plug that would fit through the tight opening of a phone battery case, and I was hoping this one would -- it doesn't, even after removing the screwed-in plug cover. Since it's not advertised as such, I see no reason to lower the rating of an otherwise good cable, but in case you're looking for a headphone cord that can replace the pigtail that came with a phone battery case, this is not it.\",\n",

For the first few weeks, I was impressed, lots of HDMI inputs, good sound quality, etc.  Approximately one month after owning, I would get intermittent video drop outs lasting 1-2 seconds. This happened maybe once every hours. Not a huge deal. Fast forawrd to 6 months and am now getting these every 5 seconds, each time lasting for 1-2 seconds. Can't watch anything due to this issue.<br /><br />I tried changing cables, changing inputs and even trying it on a small TV.  Nothing seems to work.  Called Onkyo who told me to take it to a local repair shop. After a week at the shop, I find out that this is not covered under warranty as I had purchased it from Focus Camera (resller on amazon) and not amazon.com.<br /><br />I now have a 40 lb paperweight that I need to replace.

Here are the features this speaker can do below. This product also contains a charging/Line-in cord and a handy little velvet bag for safe traveling.<br /><br />* Bluetooth pairing to listen to music (Both Pandora and Spotify worked flawless for me, as well as music downloaded onto my phone)<br />* Hands Free calling via Bluetooth<br />* Play music via the microSD card (Supports up to 64GB)<br />* FM Tuner (Another feature that worked perfect for me)<br />* Music via Line-in mode<br />* NFC pairing (Didn't work for me, see below)<br /><br />These are a ton of features that are available for this speaker. Everything worked well beyond my expectation minus the NFC pairing. For some reason, I couldn't pair my phone to the speaker using NFC. It could have been the phone case I'm using, but I didn't make too much effort to try and get it working. I prefer bluetooth over NFC anyways, so this wasn't a big deal. I'm confident if I contacted the support people, they could have fixed my problem.<br /><br />Some other cool features I like are the semi-sticky surface on the bottom of the speaker. This will definitely help against slipping away. Also, I like the way the volume/tuner work.  A quick press to the left/right will change the FM station, Pandora song, (or other streaming song), while a long press will lower the volume.<br /><br />Overall, this wireless speaker is one of the best speakers I've bought. Don't let it's small size deter you. The sound quality is way much better than I expected. What are you waiting for? If you're looking for a small and amazing wireless speaker, I highly recommend this one!<br /><br />Although I didn't use it, NUVUO seems to have a great return policy: We pride ourselves with our Guaranteed 100% Customer Satisfaction.

After very little use, the changer mechanism froze in the open position.  We found that the mechanism could be shut by depressing a pin inside the changer, but it would no longer play CDs.  I called Yamaha, and they told me I could send it to a service center in Bayshore, NY.  That is about 100 miles from my house. Tough luck, customer.  Yamaha does not pay for shipping in either direction.  So I spent close to $50 to send the product via UPS and back.  Yes, they fixed it, but I don't know for how long. The wise ass who called to say it was ready accused me of forcing the drawer shut.  Of course, I had to force the drawer shut, otherwise, there was no way to send it for repair.<br /><br />I am not happy about the difficulty obtaining warranty service.<br /><br />I find the pause feature to be unsatisfactory.  If I leave it on pause for longer than a few minutes (I am not exactly sure for how long), pressing the button again will start the CD from the beginning, instead of where it was when I pressed pause.<br /><br />Next time I will avoid Yamaha.\",\n",
